                    I am from Republic of Moldova and my dream is to become a person that makes the planet a better place!</n>
                    Since I was 8 years old I have always wanted to learn and to discover as much as I could, in other words, I am  a curious person.</n>
                    I always had a lot of passions and hobbies about differnt things like reading, sports, art and technologies.</n>
                    When I was a kid I used to practic a lot of sports, for example swimming, gymnastics, cycling etc. But for me one of the</n>
                    most important sports that I've practiced is Taekwondo. From this type of martial arts I've learned a lot of important values like</n>
                    discipline or punctuality and I've learned to never give up and to aim for the best. I've practiced this sport for 8 consecutive years</n>
                    and one of my biggest achivements would be that I was a national champion in my category multiple times and even if I lost, I stood up and came back much stronger than before.</n>
                    I love this sport and I would give anything to relive those moments, because it was one of the best experiences of my life.

                    Also one of my biggest achivements is finishing a Informatics Academy. When I was 9 years old I became very interested in Technologies and wanted to know more about this whole IT world.</n>
                    So my parents signed me up at IT Step Academy where I basically learned everything about the basics of a lot of programs. I learned there for 5 years </n>
                    And after that I was more than sure that I will learn more into detail after school at university. And that is how I ended up coming to IMC Krems, ready to learn a lot about this new world.
